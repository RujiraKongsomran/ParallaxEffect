    <string name="content_paragraph_1">The Hulk is a fictional superhero appearing in publications by the American publisher Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby, the character first appeared in the debut issue of The Incredible Hulk (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character, who has dissociative identity disorder (DID), is primarily represented by the alter Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid possessing a limitless degree of physical strength, and the alter Dr. Robert Bruce Banner, a physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist, both of whom typically resent each other.</string>
    <string name="content_paragraph_2">Despite both Hulk and Banner\'s desire for solitude, the character has a large supporting cast. This includes Banner\'s ex-wife Betty Ross, his best friend Rick Jones, his cousin She-Hulk, and therapist and ally Doc Samson. In addition, the Hulk alter ego has many key supporting characters, like his co-founders of the superhero team the Avengers, his queen Caiera, fellow warriors Korg and Miek, and sons Skaar and Hiro-Kala. However, his uncontrollable power has brought him into conflict with his fellow heroes and others. Despite this, he tries his best to do what\'s right while battling villains such as the Leader, the Abomination, the Absorbing Man and more. Lee stated that the Hulk\'s creation was inspired by a combination of Frankenstein and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. Although the Hulk\'s coloration has varied throughout the character\'s publication history, the most usual color is green. One of the most iconic characters in popular culture, the character has appeared on a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectable items, inspired real-world structures (such as theme park attractions), and been referenced in a number of media. Banner and the Hulk have been adapted in live-action, animated, and video game incarnations.</string>
